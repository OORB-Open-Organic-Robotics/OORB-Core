# OORB-Core

**OORB-Core** is the central engine behind the OORB (Open Organic Robotics) framework. It powers the core features of our AI-native robotics platform, allowing users to design, simulate, and deploy intelligent robots using natural language.

This repository includes the foundational components that make OORB work:
- ROS2-compatible infrastructure for real-time robotic system control
- AI agent integration for auto-generating code, configuration files, and hardware drivers
- Tools for deploying projects to edge devices like Raspberry Pi, Jetson, and FPGA platforms

OORB-Core connects your ideas to working robots â€” whether you're building in a classroom, a research lab, or a garage. It's built to make robotics more accessible, faster to develop, and easier to scale.
